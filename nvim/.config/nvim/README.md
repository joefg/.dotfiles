# nvim

My neovim config is intended to be halfway house between an editor and an IDE.
If you want an IDE, just use VSCode. Otherwise, this works reasonably well.

## Plugins

Plugins are managed with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), inside
`init.lua`.

## DAP

There is support for [Debug
Adapters](https://codeberg.org/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/wiki/Debug-Adapter-installation),
at the moment limited to Python files.
